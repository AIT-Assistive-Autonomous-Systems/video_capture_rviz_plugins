Adds a tool plugin to Rviz, to render the 3D view directly to video, without recording the whole screen.

Trigger recording with the `r` hotkey, and `output.mp4` will be written to the current working directory on next press of `r`.

This package is definitely built and tested for my personal use, but you can potentially use it as starting point to build something similar.
